# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the Rainy SDK project.

## Workflows Overview

### üîÑ CI (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push/PR to main/develop branches

- **Multi-platform testing:** Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Multi-Rust version testing:** Stable, beta, nightly, MSRV (1.70.0)
- **Quality checks:** Format, clippy, documentation
- **Coverage:** Code coverage reporting with Codecov

### üì¶ Release (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:** Git tag push (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

- **Automated publishing:** Publishes to crates.io
- **GitHub release:** Creates release with changelog
- **Build artifacts:** Includes release binaries

### üîí Security (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:** Daily at 2 AM UTC, manual trigger, Cargo.toml/lock changes

- **Vulnerability scanning:** Uses `cargo audit`
- **Automated issues:** Creates GitHub issues for vulnerabilities
- **Report generation:** Detailed security reports

### üìè MSRV (`msrv.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push/PR to main, manual trigger

- **Version compatibility:** Tests against minimum supported Rust version
- **Automated updates:** Can update MSRV badges
- **Compatibility reports:** Detailed MSRV compatibility reports

### üì¶ Dependencies (`dependencies.yml`)

**Triggers:** Weekly on Mondays, manual trigger

- **Automated updates:** Updates dependencies to latest compatible versions
- **PR creation:** Creates pull requests for dependency updates
- **Testing:** Runs full test suite on updated dependencies

### ‚úçÔ∏è Sign-off Verification (`verify-signoffs.yml`)

**Triggers:** Pull requests to main/develop

- **DCO compliance:** Verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-offs
- **PR comments:** Provides helpful guidance for missing sign-offs
- **Contributing alignment:** Enforces CONTRIBUTING.md requirements

## Required Secrets

For full functionality, configure these repository secrets:

- `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`: Token for publishing to crates.io
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub (requires repository permissions for releases)

### GitHub Token Permissions for Releases

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not have sufficient permissions to create releases. If you encounter a "Resource not accessible by integration" error, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Add it as `GH_PAT` secret in your repository
3. Update the release workflow to use `GH_PAT` instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`

#### Option 2: Configure Repository Permissions (Recommended)
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is checked

#### Option 3: Job-Level Permissions (Already Configured)
The release workflow now includes proper job-level permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Required for creating releases and uploading assets
```

**Current Configuration:** The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with job-level `contents: write` permission. This should resolve most permission issues without requiring repository-level changes.

## Manual Triggers

Several workflows support manual triggering via GitHub Actions UI:

- **Security Audit:** Run on-demand vulnerability scanning
- **MSRV Check:** Test against specific Rust versions
- **Dependency Updates:** Force immediate dependency updates

## Workflow Status Badges

Add these badges to your README.md:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Crates.io Publishing Fails**
   - Check `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` secret is set
   - Verify token has publish permissions

2. **GitHub Release Creation Fails**
   - **403 Permission Error:** The workflow now uses job-level `contents: write` permission (see "GitHub Token Permissions for Releases" above)
   - **Missing Crate File:** The workflow now generates the crate file automatically in the release job
   - **Version Mismatch:** Ensure the tag version matches the Cargo.toml version

3. **Security Audit Issues**
   - Some vulnerabilities may be false positives
   - Check cargo-audit documentation for overrides

4. **MSRV Compatibility**
   - Update MSRV in workflow file if needed
   - Check dependency MSRV requirements

5. **Sign-off Verification**
   - Contributors must use `git commit -s`
   - Or check "Sign off" in GitHub web interface

## Contributing

When modifying workflows:

- Test changes on a branch first
- Update this documentation
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
